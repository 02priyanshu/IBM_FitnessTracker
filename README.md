# IBM_FitnessTracker
FitnessTracker is a machine learning model designed to predict the mental health status of individuals based on various input parameters related to physical activity, lifestyle, and biometric data.
The model's predictive capabilities empower individuals to proactively monitor their mental health status and make informed decisions regarding lifestyle adjustments, stress management strategies, and seeking professional support when needed.
It was the project given to me during IBM internship.
